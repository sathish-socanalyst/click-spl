    <h2>You Know What? ✨</h2>
    <p>
        Life was going normal… usual days, usual work, usual everything.<br><br>
        And then you came.<br><br>
        Suddenly days felt lighter.<br>
        Smiles became easier.<br>
        And even silence felt comfortable.

    <h2>I Realised Something ❤️</h2>
    <p>
        It's not about big moments.<br>
        It's about the small ones…<br>
        Talking with you.<br>
        Laughing randomly.<br>
        Thinking about you for no reason.<br><br>
        You became my favorite part of the day.
